# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Security

- **Strict provider↔model binding**: model resolution no longer falls back to a global fuzzy search across all providers, and an embedded `provider/model` prefix inside `modelId` is honored only when it matches the declared target provider. A typo, removed model, or upstream rename now fails the target closed (cooldown + next declared target) instead of resolving another provider's model and sending it the prompt and the declared provider's credential.
- **Policy rules fail closed**: `exclude-provider` and `force-billing` are now hard boundaries. The candidate fallback chain stays inside the policy-filtered set; when no policy-compliant target remains, routing errors with an explanation instead of silently restoring excluded or wrongly-billed providers. Documented budget fail-open behavior is unchanged, but it now operates within the filtered set too. Shadow mode also respects exclusions.
- **Failover no longer leaks the first provider's terminal `done`**: a `done` event carrying a retryable error is classified before forwarding; the outer stream only terminates with the final selected target's result. Previously, adapters reporting retryable failures as completed messages closed the stream with the first provider's error even when a fallback target succeeded.
- **Credential file permissions**: `writeAuth` writes temporary files with mode `0600` and enforces `0600` after rename, so OAuth refreshes no longer replace a private `auth.json` with a world-readable file under permissive umasks. Parent directories are created with `0700`.
- **Usage endpoint overrides are validated**: `PI_GEMINI_USAGE_ENDPOINT` / `PI_ANTIGRAVITY_USAGE_ENDPOINT` are honored only for HTTPS URLs on expected Google hosts; anything else falls back to the default endpoint instead of sending OAuth bearer tokens to arbitrary (possibly plaintext) URLs.
- **Global system-prompt nudge is opt-in**: the `before_agent_start` tool-naming nudge (which modifies the system prompt of every agent run, not just auto-router requests) is now disabled by default; enable with `AUTO_ROUTER_TOOL_NUDGE=1`.
- **Host-registered provider APIs can be routed**: inner streaming now prefers the host `ModelRegistry` provider's own `streamSimple` when available, falling back to pi-ai's legacy compat dispatch. Providers with custom host-registered APIs (e.g. Devin's `devin-local`) previously failed with `No API provider registered for api: ...` when routed, even though they worked when selected directly.

## 0.2.4

**Release date:** 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- The routed-model status integration is now maintained in this package and owns its timer and `FSWatcher` per Pi session. Resources start idempotently from `session_start`, are invalidated and closed during every `session_shutdown`, and late Node callbacks cannot access a stale extension context after reload/new/resume/fork.
- Routed-model status tail reads now use a positioned, bounded read of the final 64 KiB instead of synchronously loading the entire append-only event log on every poll. Missing, empty, concurrently appended, malformed, and partial JSONL records are handled without escaping exceptions.
- Router events now carry the current Pi session id, and model status filters the global event log by that id to prevent another session/process from changing the displayed model. Legacy untagged events remain available to analytics but are not used for session-filtered status initialization.
- Route targets with `authProvider` can now fall back to provider API-key environment variables when pi auth is missing or expired.
- Credential resolution now accepts API keys stored in `auth.json`'s `key` field and Pi's canonical provider variables such as `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`.
- Per-token targets without `authProvider` are excluded when no stored or environment provider API key is available instead of being reported as healthy.
- Gemini example-config tests now match the configured `gemini-3.6-flash` model.

### Changed
- Credential loading, expiration checks, environment-variable resolution, and target credential checks now live in the tested `src/auth.ts` module.

## 0.2.3

### Fixed
- **claude-agent-sdk API wrapping**: `resolveModelFromRegistry` / `getInnerModel` no longer overrides `api` and `baseUrl` to `"claude-agent-sdk"` on wrapped models. The removed API provider caused `No API provider registered for api: claude-agent-sdk` crashes on any route config that still referenced it. The underlying model's real API now passes through unchanged.
- **Route maxTokens passthrough**: The route config's `maxTokens` value is now forwarded to the inner model via `SimpleStreamOptions.maxTokens`. Previously it was silently dropped, causing models with low native output limits (e.g. GLM-5.1 at ~16K) to truncate mid-response with `Model stopped because it reached the maximum output token limit` on large-context requests.
- **DEFAULT_ROUTES / DEFAULT_ALIASES**: Hardcoded fallbacks no longer contain `claude-agent-sdk` or `nvidia` targets. They now match the current provider lineup: moonshotai, deepseek, openai-codex, google, ollama.
- **Example config**: `auto-router.routes.example.json` updated to match the live config structure.

## Unreleased — Quality Signal Telemetry

**Shipped:** 2026-05-07
**Tests:** 414 passing across 74 suites

### Added
- Pi-style append-only router event log at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/auto-router.events.jsonl`
- `scripts/routing-stats.mjs` for post-hoc routing analysis, modeled after pi session stats scripts
- `scripts/routing-quality-stats.mjs` for feedback/quality analysis across route, provider, model, intent, subtask, tags, and planned→actual drift
- Richer decision logging for routing analysis and future policy learning
- Per-request `requestId` and best-effort `conversationId`
- SWE subtask-aware routing heuristics for coding prompts:
  - implementation
  - debugging
  - refactor
  - testing
  - review
  - devops
- Prior-turn quality signals for coding flows:
  - repair / follow-up detection
  - observed `testOutcome` / `buildOutcome`
  - structured validation signals from prior bash tool results
- Planned-vs-actual target logging:
  - `plannedProvider`, `plannedModelId`, `plannedTargetLabel`
  - actual `provider`, `modelId`, `targetLabel`
- `attempts[]` chain telemetry for each routed request:
  - attempt index
  - provider/model
  - label
  - outcome (`success`, `retryable_failure`, `terminal_error`)
  - latency
  - error message
- `candidateTrace[]` for the full candidate set, including:
  - config rank
  - final rank
  - UVI bucket (`promoted`, `normal`, `demoted`)
  - candidate status (`selected`, `eligible`, `constraint_rejected`, `budget_rejected`, `unhealthy`, `cooldown`, `circuit_open`)
  - machine-readable rejection/ranking reasons
  - average latency and estimated cost snapshots
- `reasoningStructured` alongside the existing human-readable `reasoning` string
- Validation trace extraction for common coding commands (`npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `tsc`, `npm run build`, etc.)
- Subtask-aware provider preference hints layered on top of existing route strategy rules

### Changed
- Coding intent classification now includes optional SWE subtask detection and confidence
- Router now dual-writes both the legacy decision log and the new event-style router log
- `/auto-router rate` now attributes feedback to the most recent completed routed request, using the actual route ID and executed target instead of `Map` insertion order + provider-as-route fallback
- Router applies lightweight subtask-specific provider preferences before final ranking, while still letting explicit strategy rules override them
- Decision log now records the model/provider that actually executed after failover, not just the initially planned target
- `RoutingDecision` now carries structured reasoning, follow-up metadata, and validation-trace metadata for downstream analysis
- Decision logs now include `isFollowUp`, `isRepair`, `previousRequestId`, `testOutcome`, and `buildOutcome` when available
- Decision log validation remains backward-compatible with older entries while accepting the richer schema

### Why this matters
- Makes it possible to audit why a model won, not just which model won
- Adds lightweight quality labels for coding workflows without needing a full self-improvement loop yet
- Unblocks future work on quality-aware heuristics, replay evaluation, and self-improving routing loops
- Fixes a major observability gap in chain routing where planned and executed targets could differ

## 0.2.0 — Policy Engine, Circuit Breaker & Dynamic Budget Reallocation

**Release date:** 2026-04-27
**Tests:** 258 passing across 48 suites

### Major Features

#### Utilization Velocity Index (UVI) — Dynamic Budget Reallocation
- Real-time OAuth quota monitoring from Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, and Google
- Three-tier dynamic routing adjustment:
  - **Critical** (UVI ≥ 2.0): provider blocked from selection
  - **Stressed** (UVI ≥ 1.5): candidates demoted to end of trial order
  - **Surplus** (UVI ≤ 0.5 & window ≥ 70% elapsed): candidates promoted to front
- Integrated with budget auditor for quota-aware failover
- Default-on with `/auto-router uvi enable|disable` toggle
- Hard mode (`AUTO_ROUTER_UVI_HARD=1`) — excludes stressed providers entirely
- `/auto-router uvi show` with per-provider diagnostics
- UVI status in status line and `/auto-router explain` output

#### Policy Engine (5 Rule Types)
- **force-tier** — override auto-detected tier
- **prefer-provider** — boost specific providers in trial order
- **exclude-provider** — block providers from selection
- **force-billing** — enforce subscription vs. per-token billing
- **force-constraint** — add reasoning/vision/context window requirements
- Route-scoped rules (`routeId` field) prevent cross-route interference
- Time-of-day/weekday conditions with overnight range support
- Priority-ordered rule evaluation with dry-run traces
- `/auto-router rules` command for visibility
- `/auto-router explain` shows per-rule ✅/❌ evaluation

#### Circuit Breaker
- Closed → Open → Half-open state machine
- Configurable: `failureThreshold` (default 3), `windowMs` (60s), `cooldownMs` (30s)
- Integrated at constraint solver (prevents selection) and `tryTarget` loop (records success/failure)
- `/auto-router circuit` command + status line segment with 🔌 indicator

#### Per-Token Budget Tracking (Phase 7.5)
- Balance fetching from provider APIs (DeepSeek: `GET https://api.deepseek.com/user/balance`)
- Monthly budgets via `/auto-router budget set <provider> <usd> monthly`
- Auto-detection: any provider with a monthly budget treated as per-token
- API key resolution: `auth.json` first, then environment variables
- UVI computed identically to subscription providers
- Same audit thresholds: 80% → warning, 100% → blocked
- `/auto-router balance show|fetch` commands

#### Cost-Aware Ranking
- Estimated USD cost as secondary tiebreaker within UVI latency buckets
- `lookupModelCost` / `estimateModelCost` (4× output token multiplier)
- Cost surfaced in routing reasoning output
- Latency-first, cost-second within promoted/normal/demoted partitions

#### Enhanced Intent Classification
- Heuristic classifier: code, creative, analysis, general intents
- File extension support: `.java`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.md`, `.rst`, `.adoc`
- Documentation patterns: README, CHANGELOG detection
- Conversation depth boost: +2 for 5+ messages, +1 for 3+
- Mapped to tier hints in routing pipeline
- Displayed in `/auto-router explain` with confidence scores

#### Performance-Based Ranking
- Rolling average per-provider latency tracking (max 100 samples)
- Candidates sorted fastest-first within promoted/normal/demoted UVI buckets
- Persistent across restarts (`auto-router.latency.json`)
- Cold-start: providers with no history sort last within their bucket

#### Provider Health Checks
- OAuth token verification with TTL cache (60s default)
- Filters unhealthy providers before constraint solving
- Independent of UVI; feeds `isHealthy` into constraint solver
- Health issues surfaced in `/auto-router list`

#### Architecture & Code Quality
- Extracted `src/display.ts` — 42 tests for model spec parsing, target description, hints formatting, cooldown helpers, token normalization
- Pipeline integration tests — 9 end-to-end scenarios (constraint → budget → partition)
- Quota cache tests — 6 tests covering all provider → OAuth mappings
- Balance fetcher retry — exponential backoff (500ms base, 2 retries)
- 17 modular `src/` files from original monolithic `index.ts`

### New Commands
- `/auto-router uvi [show|enable|disable|refresh]`
- `/auto-router shadow [show|enable|disable]`
- `/auto-router rules`
- `/auto-router circuit`
